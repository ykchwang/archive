              <p style="color: #000">Description:<br>These 10 diary entries is about user interactions with any information environment (computer, person, facility) where the interactive experience is challenged by poor or uninformed design choices. Each entry covered the context of occurrence, the nature of the problem from the user’s perspective, an analytical/theoretical framing of the experience, and a clear recommendation for re-design that would improve the experience.</p>

              <h2>Design Diary 01 – Smart TV</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>Smart TV has become more popular these days, as what we watch comes from the Internet more, such as Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and HBO. Smart TV is a television set with integrated Internet and interactive "Web 2.0" features. Sometimes I would watch videos/movies recommended by the system, however, most of the time, I already have what I want to watch in my mind. That’s where the search function comes in. In this design critique, I will focus mainly on the YouTube application.</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p>The keyboard interface (as shown in Fig. 1) is really difficult to use, as it can only be controlled via the remote (Fig. 2).<blockquote>- Inconsistency: The order of the alphabet is inconsistent with the keyboard we are used to on computers or mobile phones.<br>
              - Inefficient: Users can only type using direction key. Meaning if I want to spell d-o-g, I would have to choose “d”, then navigate to “o” by pressing “down” two times, “left” three times, and press “select”, then I’ll have to repeat the process for each alphabet I want to choose. It is time consuming and pushes the user away.
              </blockquote></p>

              <h3>Current Solutions</h3>
              <p><blockquote>- Using mobile phones to search for videos, then project it on screen<br>- Attach additional keyboard</blockquote></p>
              <h3>Insights</h3>
              <p>Although current solutions are fine there are still some problems<blockquote>- Mobile phones: Users have to make a queue for the videos you want to play, it won’t auto-play videos.<br>- Attach additional keyboard: Users have to buy additional keyboard just to make typing easier. Additional keyboards have large size.<br>- Have to switch between keyboard and remote when switch between cable and web applications.</blockquote></p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>I believe keyboard is a good idea, but the thought of having to buy and use an additional large keyboard is not economical. I was thinking integrating the remote with keyboard, something like Fig. 3, but instead of the screen, it’s the remote on top (shown in Fig. 4). I believe this design can make using the search function easier to use. In addition, the keyboard will be consistent with keyboard people are used to, as consistency is in design is virtuous (Norman, D. (2013)).</p>

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 4 Remote with keyboard concept, like the Slide Smartphone, the keyboard is concealed under the remote and can slide out when needed.</p>
              <h3>Potential Flaws</h3>
              <p>I believe there are potential flaws with my redesign.<blockquote>- Cost: With the addition of the keyboard, the cost of manufacturing the remote may be significantly higher<br>- Size: There is a trade-off between the size of the remote and the keyboard, the remote would have to be hand-held size, and the keyboard would have to be as large as possible</blockquote></p>

              <h2>Design Diary 02 – Lemonade Website</h2>              
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>Lemonade is a company that provides housing insurance. The website is clean and simple, easy to use for first-timers (Fig. 1). I first used the website when I arrived at Austin to check in to my apartment, as the leasing office requested that I apply for a housing insurance right away. It was my first time applying for an insurance in the States, and I was a bit anxious. However, the website was clean and simple, the whole process took only 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>The problem came when I wanted to change my insurance details. I looked all over the website and couldn’t find a way to login to my own account. It took me a few moments to remember that I can login to my account from my mobile app.</p>
              <img src="assets/img/design diary/lemonade website.png">
              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 1 Lemonade Home Page</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p>Accessibility: Although the user’s account can be accessed through the mobile app, the accessibility can be improved for web-oriented users.</p>
              <p>Consistency: After signing up for insurance the first time on the web, users will try to access their account through the web instead of the app.</p>
              <h3>Insights</h3>
              <p>The Lemonade app is actually solely for accessing the user’s account. Users can change their insurance coverage and edit their profile such as address, phone number, username, password, etc.</p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>I would add an account icon to the top-right corner (Fig. 2). Top-right to bring consistency as most systems put their account there, such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. After clicking the icon, users can also access their insurance and account through the web.</p>

              <h2>Design Diary 03 – Automatic Door</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>In my home country, Taiwan, automatic doors are usually all glass, with no sign or handle, only the sensor at the top to indicate that it’s an automatic door, as shown in Fig. 1. I was used to it, no handle and all glass means automatic door, it would open as soon I get close to it. In the U.S., however, automatic doors usually have signs and handles, which confused my greatly at first, shown in Fig. 2. In addition, some automatic doors can be opened manually in the U.S., which is a big difference with Taiwan, as automatic doors will break if opened manually. It took a great deal of time getting used to it, as I would stand in front of an automatic door, hesitating to open the door manually, afraid I might break it.</p>

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 2 Automatic doors in the US</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p>It is very confusing as automatic doors in the U.S. all have the yellow sign on the door indicating it is automatic. I would have to check for sensors, door handles, and switches, just to get out or get in a building. Automatic door in the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin has an automatic door that can be opened by a switch or manually (Fig. 3). Going through the door the first few times was challenging for me, as I wasn’t sure how to open it. Although the sign at the bottom did read “activate switch to open”, I miss the sign as the yellow above it was grabbing my attention (Balk, M., et al (2013)).</p>

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 3 Automatic door in the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin</p>
              <h3>Insights</h3>
              <p><blockquote>-  For this situation, the text for “activate switch to operate” is too small and must stand out more.<br>- From a distance, yellow is too vivid, whereas blue gets overlooked, thus, users might assume it was an automatic door with sensors.</blockquote></p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>The re-design I propose is to turn bottom half of the sign (“activate switch to operate”) into the same format as the top half, which is to make the background and text color consistent. I believe this would let users view the sign as one, according to the Gestalt Principle of closure (Johnson, J. (2014)). Then users will notice and read the bottom half of the sign, understanding that the automatic door will need to be opened by a switch.</p>

              <h2>Design Diary 04 – Canvas</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>Canvas is a platform for students and faculty to share information and communicate regarding school courses at the University of Texas at Austin. There are two version of it, web and app. Although the overall design is usable, I believe there are some tweaks that can made to greatly improve the user experience.</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p><blockquote>- Inconsistency between webpage and app:<br>As mobile phones are getting more popular nowadays (Pew Reseach Center (2018)), applications tend to have a mobile version in addition to the web version. Consistency between web and app versions are important as it can reduce the learning curve and become easier to use (Budiu, R. (2016)). In Canvas, however, inconsistency is found at the menu of the web and app version. The placement of the menu bar in the web version is on the left while the app version the menu is at the bottom. Furthermore, the tabs in the menu are not identical (Fig. 1). This inconsistency leads to confusion and is unintuitive for the users.
              <img src="assets/img/design diary/canvas.png">
              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 1 Menu of the web version (left) and app version (right). Different in the orientation of placement and number of tabs</p>
              - Grouping of courses of Courses tab:<br>I have a course in Understanding & Serving Users and another in Understanding Research. Because the courses are listed in alphabetic order, the two courses are aligned with each other. When I want to click on one of the courses, I have to process which one I want to select (Fig. 2). The problem lasted for a few weeks, when the selection process should already be automatic. In addition, all texts start with Fa18, and in all capital letters, which makes accessing the courses more challenging. As wordy, repetitive words slow users down (Johnson, J. (2014)), and all caps text is less legible and readable than lower-case text (Wheildon, C. (1995), Nielsen, J. (2015)). Thus taking more time to process and making it easier to make mistakes.

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 2 Course tab. All starts with Fa18 and in all capital letters</p>
              - Color coding of Dashboard tab:<br>In Dashboard, there are different colors for each course, but the color meaning for each course is baffling. For example, the color for courses HCI and iSchool Summer Transition are the same, but there are no connections between the courses, this is misleading for first time users (Fig. 3).

              </blockquote></p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>Icons for the web and app version have to be consistent (Fig.4). Furthermore, in the web version, the tab Dashboard and Courses actually have the same function, I recommend the removal of the Courses tab. In addition, users can customize the colors of their courses based on their preferences.</p>

              <h2>Design Diary 05 – Shower Faucet Control</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>Taking showers is a part of human everyday activity (most people), it induces good hygiene, which can prevent germs and attract mates. To take a shower, users would have to know how to turn on the water, and also regulate the temperature of the water to best suit their preference.</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p>The shower faucet control of the apartment I rented has a big flaw (see Fig. 01). When I tried to take a shower for the first time, I did not know how to turn on the water and control the temperature.<br>From past experience, I know from the switch on the faucet that water will come out through the faucet first, and after I pull the switch, will come out through the shower head. However, there isn’t any indication as to how to turn on the water. Should I pull it or turn it? The hot/cold water control is not intuitive either, the label only says “TEMP” which I assume means temperature, with arrows pointing both sides. Which way is cold water? Which way is hot water?</p>

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 01: Shower Faucet Control</p>
              <h3>Insights</h3>
              <p>The problem here is the presentation of cognitive affordance. It should support user sensory needs in seeing cognitive affordance by effective presentation (Hartson, R., Pyla, P. (2012)). The label of the control is not clear enough for users, as users does not know how to use it.</p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>As the two main problem of the control is to turn on the water and temperature control, my recommendation for re-design is focused on those two functions (See Fig. 02).<blockquote>1. My recommendation for turning on/off the water is to simply add a label. This improves the cognitive affordance part in the interaction cycle (Hartson, R., Pyla, P. (2012)).<br>2. As for temperature control, not only did I add label, but also color coding to the control. While the label is for the user’s cognitive affordance (Hartson, R., Pyla, P. (2012)), the color coding makes the control more intuitive through consistency (Norman, D. (2013)), as blue is usually cold water and red is hot water.</blockquote></p>

              <h2>Design Diary 06 – YouTube Recommendation System</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>YouTube is the world’s largest video streaming platform in the world. It offers a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. I use YouTube every day for leisure and learning. YouTube has a recommendation algorithm that recommends videos based on users’ past video contents. The algorithm is implemented so users can keep watching videos. For users, because the videos recommended are ones related to interest, so people will keep on watching; for YouTube, each video watch will generate revenue from advertisement.</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p style="font-style: italic;">Persona:</p>
              <p>Name: Billy Chen.<br>Age: 23 years old<br>Profession: Student<br>Location: Austin, TX</p>
              <p>Bio:<br>Billy is a first year international graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin from China. In his leisure time, he likes to watch videos online. Back in China, he watched videos from YouKu and QQ Video, as those are the main platform for video streaming. He became a frequent YouTube user after arriving in the U.S. At first, he likes the clean design of YouTube, how everyone can upload videos, and the way YouTube recommends videos related to his interest. However, after some time, he becomes annoyed that all the videos shown at the “customized” YouTube homepage are similar. He would like something new and different but still wants to watch videos that interests him.</p>              
              <h3>Insights</h3>
              One of the problem with the recommendation system of YouTube is that the content of the recommended videos have become too narrow. For example, if a user watched unboxing videos several times, YouTube will start recommending the user all kinds of channels related to unboxing. However, the user might also like other categories such as gaming or late night shows, but won’t have access to them unless the user search for it directly. This problem is more oriented toward the algorithm design rather than the interface design.
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              Though the algorithm for videos recommendation of YouTube is a trade secret, it’s safe to say that two things have a very strong impact on what YouTube ends up recommending: search history and watch history (Lee, J. (2013)). I believe YouTube can recommend videos from the popularity of the videos nationally/worldwide. This will recommend videos outside of the search and watch history, and also recommend new contents. After several attempts, YouTube can gradually learn about a user’s different interests and recommend videos that covers all interests, while also providing novel contents. Novel contents are important as human humans as a species are characterized by novelty- and intensity-seeking (Zuckerman, M. (2007)).

              <h2>Design Diary 07 – Transit</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>Transit is a mobile application that the students at the University of Texas at Austin uses for public transportation (Fig. 1). Its main function is to recommend the fastest way of public transportation to reach the user’s desired destination, and has Google Maps integrated in the app. There are two features of the app that I really like, and use it on a daily basis.<br>The first feature is that you can see the estimated time of a specific bus route (shown in Fig. 2). You can use this information to plan for trips.<br>The second feature that I like is that it searches for different bus routes of the user’s destination input. Although Google Maps also have this feature, Transit offers more options of public transportation. It even estimates time if users are taking Uber, Lyft, or even BCycle (Fig. 3).</p>

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 3 All Recommended Bus Route for Desired Destination</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p>I’ve started using this app ever since I came here to Austin. There are two significant problems that I’ve encountered during my use of the mobile application.<br><blockquote>1.  I had already got on Bus 671, trying to get to the Recreational Sports Center on campus. I was on highway I-35 when trying to find out where the stops are and when to get off, but I couldn’t find the route of the bus I was on.<br>I found out later why:<blockquote>- You can only gain access to the bus route and the location of the stops after clicking on “GO” (Fig. 4).<br> Routes 600-699 are the UT shuttles, which means they will travel between the school and one of the off-campus housing areas (Far West, West Campus, Hyde Park, Riverside, etc.), without making a stop in between. Because I did not click on “GO”, and I was on the highway, the app did not detect that I was already on Bus 671, and was trying to find the nearest bus route near me. Thus I couldn’t gain access to the information about bus 671.

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 4.</p>
              </blockquote>
              2.  On Labor Day holiday, I was planning to go to St. Marcos. As I didn’t have a car, I considered going by either Lyft or Greyhound. Lyft by itself was too expensive, so I was considering using Transit to search for the south-most bus stop, then take Lyft from there. I couldn’t find the bus network map anywhere on the app, and even not on the Capital Metro official website last time I checked. However, I found it as I was writing this design diary (Fig. 5).

              </blockquote></p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>I believe by adding a search function, users can search for buses directly, rather than relying on the user’s location (Fig. 6). This way, even if the user forgot to click “GO”, they can still make up by searching directly by the bus number, in other words, being more forgiving to users (Norman, (2013)).</p>

              <p>The second problem can be solved by implementing the CapMetro System Map into Transit.</p>

              <h2>Design Diary 08 - AC Control of Honda Odyssey</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>My friends and I went to Houston last week, and the friend who was driving borrowed Honda Odyssey from his friend to drive us there. We left early in the morning, and the weather was getting warmer on the way to Houston. That’s when my friend (the driver) decided to turn on the air conditioner (Fig. 1). However, after he turned it on, hot air was coming out of the vents on his side, where the air was cool on my side, the passenger’s side. As he was still driving, I tried to figure out why his vents were pouring hot air whereas vents on my side were normal. But I still couldn’t figure out where the problem was, so we left it. It was when we were getting back from Houston that I decided to give it a try again, then I finally figured it out.</p>

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 1 AC Control Panel of Honda Odyssey</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p>The solution was that the driver and the passenger’s vent was different, you can adjust the temperature by the switches “DR”, the driver’s, and “PASS”, the passenger’s.<br>It was easy to understand after I had figured it out. But it still confused my friend and I the first time we tried to use it. There was a big gulf between execution and evaluation (Norman, D. (2013)).<br>There are a few flaws with the design:<blockquote>1.  The cars we used to drive only had only one control for the air conditioner, such as the 2002 Toyota Camry and the 2015 Mitsubishi Colt Plus (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The AC control panel of Honda Odyssey conflicted with our mental model. A mental model is a person’s intuitive understanding of how something functions based on his or her past encounters, exposure to information, and sound judgment (Ballav, A. (2016)). In this case, the design contradicted with our past experiences with AC controller.

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 3 2015 Mitsubishi Colt Plus</p>
              2.  Another problem was that we thought the “A/C” button located at the bottom right corner meant turning on/off the air conditioner. So when we saw that the AC indicator was on (on the screen), but the air coming out was warm, we were confused. A design should make it possible to determine the system’s status readily, easily, accurately, and in a form consistent with the person’s goals, plans, and expectations (Norman, D. (2013)).<br>3. The third problem is that we did consider the fact that the vent of the driver’s and the passenger’s were different. The display shows the temperature of the air that is coming out of the vents, so when the display shows that the vents’ temperature were the same but one was having hot air and the other cool air we were puzzled. We tried to lower the driver’s side temperature by 5 degrees, but the air was still warm. It was only after lowering to 10 degrees did the air coming out started to be cool.
              </blockquote></p>
              <h3>Insights</h3>
              <p>There are mainly three problems to fix:<blockquote>1.  Different from user’s mental model.<br>2. Confusing feedback after action.<br>3.  Inconsistency feedback</blockquote>I believe the separation of the driver’s and passenger’s air vents is a cool function, but it needs to be more intuitive for first time users that are not familiar with the function.<br>I believe the other buttons are also confusing, but I’ll focus on the AC control for this re-design. Thus the other buttons will be the same.</p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>The re-design for the control panel (Fig. 4).</p>

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 4 Re-design</p>
              <p>Concept:<br>I believe the manufacturer wanted to let users control the air condition separately, however, the original design confused users (my friend and I) because we thought the button “A/C” meant air conditioner for all vents. Thus the re-design completely separates the control for temperature and strength of fans of each vents. In other words, the removal of the button “A/C” and power of the fans. I believe this re-design would let users understand the control for the driver’s, passenger’s, and rear air vents are different.</p>

              <h2>Design Diary 09 - iPad Case</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>The iPad is aimed at filling a gap between smartphones and laptop computers, offering another mobile device option for consumers. iPad are cheaper, lighter, and thinner than laptops, and the portability and ease of use is also a plus. In addition to buying just the iPad, some people also include the Apple Pencil in their purchase, as it would make taking notes and drawing graphs on the go easier. Unlike the new Apple Pencil that came out just this November, the old one did not have a magnet to automatically attach itself to the side of the iPad. Thus, for convenience, people would buy an additional iPad case/cover to protect the iPad and hold the Apple Pencil.</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p>Although there are a lot of iPad case on the market, the one my friend owns (Ztotop Newest iPad 9.7 Inch 2018 Case with Pencil Holder, Fig. 1) has two major issues:</p>
              <img src="assets/img/design diary/ipad case.jpg">
              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 1. Ztotop Newest iPad 9.7 Inch 2018 Case with Pencil Holder</p>
              <p><blockquote>1. The holder for the Apple Pencil is too small (Fig. 2) and made with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The holder should be tight in case the Apple Pencil falls off, but the material should be softer, so user’s finger can slip in to pick up the Apple Pencil. The addition of the two holes at either side does not help, as those holes are also too small. My thinnest finger is my pinkie at 1.5 cm wide, and my friend’s index finger (which she usually uses to pull out the Apple Pencil) is 1.3 cm wide, however, the hole is only 0.9 cm wide. I can’t pull out the pencil at all, and my friend can barely do it.

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 2. The Ztotop iPad Case</p>
              2.  One of the features is that the case can be used to act as a stand, so the iPad can be tilted at two different angles according to the user’s liking (Fig. 3). The problem with this feature is that the user cannot control the viewing angle of the screen.

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 3. Stable Tri-fold Stand</p>
              </blockquote></p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>A change of material should be able to solve the first problem. Although I am not majored in Materials Science and Engineering, I believe there are special materials that are softer but still have good protection against force.<br>The second problem can be solved by having “stoppers” so the users can decide which angle they prefer (Fig. 4).</p>

              <h3>Aftermath</h3>
              <p>There is actually a better way to pull out the Apple Pencil. I only found out after studying the product on Amazon, where my friend bought it. My friend thought the two holes on either side was for pulling out the pencil, but on the contrary, it is used to hold the pencil also (Fig. 3). There are actually two additional holes on the back of the pencil holder (Fig. 5). However, my friend has used the product for 3 months now and have never discovered it, stating that it is covered by the Apple Pencil most of the time. Maybe the product should add a little indication as to how to remove the Apple Pencil, as “users should never be at fault” (Dillon 2018).</p>

              <h2>Design Diary 10 - Bus Stop</h2>
              <h3>Context of Occurrence</h3>
              <p>For every Capital MetroRapid’s bus stop in Austin, there is a LED sign indicating the wait time for passengers (Fig. 1). This is a good design as it allows users to feel that are in control (Weinschenk, S. (2011)). However, the digital sign only displays MetroRapid’s route, which has a total of two, 801 and 803. I originally thought there were no signs for other bus routes, until I discovered one on Guadalupe and 21st st (Fig. 2). I the sign was very helpful, as I liked to see how long I have to wait without using the app by Capital Metro. I was confused as to why the digital sign wasn’t implemented at other bus stops.</p>
              <img src="assets/img/design diary/bus stop.jpg">

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 2. Unexpected Digital Sign for Bus Routes</p>
              <h3>Problem from User’s Perspective</h3>
              <p>Although the sign is helpful, I had only noticed it after a few weeks. In other words, the sign is not noticeable:<blockquote>-  The size of the sign is too small<br>-  The sign is too tall (around 7 feet), the average male height is 175.7 cm, and the average female height is 161.8 cm (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2016). In addition, Normal line of sight during the walking process is about 10 degrees downward from horizontal (U.S. Department of Defense (1974), Fig. 3), which means at 6 feet tall, the sign is not noticeable
              <img src="assets/img/design diary/line of sight.png">
              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 3. Normal Standing Line of Sight</p>
              - Users can only see the sign from one direction (Fig. 4). When you’re coming from the right side, you don’t even know it’s a sign (I thought it was a solar panel at first).

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 4. Sign Orientation</p>
              - It’s too far away from the bus stop itself (Fig. 5).

              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 5. Too far away from Bus Stop</p>
              </blockquote></p>
              <h3>Insights</h3>
              <p>The digital sign itself is very helpful, just not fitted to human ergonomics.</p>
              <h3>Recommendation for Re-design</h3>
              <p>The main problem with the digital sign is that it’s not noticeable, thus, the recommendation I propose is similar to the one of Capital RapidMetro (Fig. 6).</p>
              <img src="assets/img/design diary/redesign of bus stop.png">
              <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig. 6. Re-design of Bus stop</p>
              <p>This re-design compensates for the noticeability of the digital sign. It’s not too small, not too high, noticeable from both sides, and right at the bus stop. The difference with the Capital RapidMetro is how many routes displayed, as Capital RapidMetro only need to display 2 routes. If there are more than 4 routes at the station, it would update the screen every few seconds.</p>
