        		<h2>Overview</h2>
        		<p>Volunteering can gain a sense of accomplishment while enabling stronger relationships and is beneficial to the society. According to the study of volunteering trend in America in 2015 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, volunteer rates were <b>lowest among 20 to 24-year-olds</b> (18.4%). We decided tackle this issue by proposing a mobile application as 86% of Americans in this age group uses a smartphone on a daily basis. Thus, our app aims to encourage them to volunteer by making it <b>accessible.</b></p>
				<h2>Design Process</h2>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="assets/img/wevol_project/Process.png">
				<h2>Interview</h2>
				<p>I started off with an interview to learn about our potential target audience. Including painpoints they face, current habits, objectives, and motivation.</p>
				<img style="width: 100%;" src="assets/img/wevol_project/Volunteer.png">
				<h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
				<p>I then gathered <b>qualitative data</b> from the interviews and formed them into sticky notes. By categorizing the sticky notes, the affinity diagram gave us insight to: <blockquote>&#8226 Current volunteering process<br>&#8226 Motivations<br>&#8226 Expectations</blockquote></p>

				<p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig: Work Activity Affinity Diagram</p>
				<h2>Requirements & Modeling - Hierarchical Task Inventory</h2>
				<p>The creation of the hierarchical task inventory pointed out the <b>hierarchical relationships between the tasks and subtasks.</b> In turn helping me determine what features in our app should be more important.</p>
				<img style="display:block;width: 70%;margin:auto;" src="assets/img/wevol_project/HTIM.png">
				<p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;">Fig: Hierarchical Task Inventory Model</p>
				<h2>Design - Persona</h2>
				<p>I developed a persona based on the qualitative data we extracted from the interviews. The persona is useful as it <b>provides us with goals and characteristics of our target audience.</b></p>
				<img style="display:block;width: 70%;margin:auto;" src="assets/img/wevol_project/Persona.png">
				<h2>Design - Ideation & Sketches</h2>
				<p>I started our ideation process with questions like what is a volunteer event, how people do it, and why people do it. Understanding the meaning of volunteer event gives me insight to the motivation of volunteering. Likewise, understanding how people do it <b>led me to recognize the current flaws</b> of seeking and participating in events. These information are essential since I can <b>propose solutions to the problem space that current platforms may lack.</b></p>
				<p>I started the sketch based on the persona that I came up with. Then I brainstormed the possible features that I concluded from the ideation.</p>

				<h2>Design - Storyboard</h2>
				<p>I developed the storyboard based on the workflow model, work roles interaction diagram, and the information flow. The storyboard is used to simply our system's usage.</p>
				<img style="display:block;width: 70%;margin:auto;" src="assets/img/wevol_project/Storyboard.png">
				<h2>Prototype</h2>
				<p>I initially did a low fidelity prototype, and included factors I gathered from the interviews. After doing some pilot test on the low-fi prototype, I adjusted our medium-fi prototype based on the feedbacks.</p>
				<p>For the medium-fi prototype, I focused more on the depth of the features rather than the quantity. Since feedback from the pilot test indicated that we tried to cram too much information in the app. Thus, downsizing of the features led to cleaner, simpler, and more easier-to-understand interface.</p>
				<h2 style="color: #008EB0;font-size:20px;">Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
				<p>I started off with a <b>low-fi prototype on Balsamiq</b> as it provides a clear framework of our concept without the distraction of visual elements. The UI of this prototype included elements that we came up with from our own experiences of using other mobile apps.</p>
				<p>The low fidelity prototype was made with Balsamiq.  <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i3btgT9CpUWxFaah491pBKZgm-go4ja_" target="blank">Download

				<h2 style="color: #008EB0;font-size:20px;">Medium Fidelity Prototype</h2>
				<p>After understanding the users’ mental model through the <b>low-fi prototype pilot test</b>, our team decided to build a <b>medium fidelity prototype on Figma</b>. We switched to Figma as it is a cloud-based tool which encourages collaboration on a project simultaneously. We referred to iOS design guidelines and adapted the relevant elements from there, considering iOS is the dominent operating system in the US in 2018 (Statcounter, 2019).</p>
				<p>Prototype:</p>

                <h2>Evaluation - Usability Testing</h2>
                <p>I designed four user tasks to test the usability of our prototype:<blockquote><br>1. Create an account to log in WeVol<br>2. Find the volunteer activity “Habitat for Humanity” in Austin and register for it<br>3. Approve the friend request from Diana Klaus<br>4. Cancel the activity you have registered for</blockquote></p>
                <p>I asked users to go through the tasks, requesting that they think out loud so I can understand their thought process. In addition, I also ask them to write down all the steps during each task, and let them rate the difficulty of each task after completing them. Finally, I asked for their thoughts about our prototype.</p>
                <h2>Future Work</h2>
                <p>Through the usability test, I learned that there is a need to divide long-term volunteer activities and one-time volunteer activities. Since the objective, time dedicated, training, etc. would be vastly different. In addition, our app should also include function for the organizer of the events, considering they are also an important role in the process of volunteering.<hr></p>
